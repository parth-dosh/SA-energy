# SA-energy

## I volunteered with a South African nonprofit, Imagine Scholar, to model the country's economic development and environmental sustainability and whether these topics were linked to its energy production. To conduct this project, I used unsupervised machine learning (KMeans Clustering model) in order to classify the country's economic performance from 1985-2018 into 3 different clusters (environmentally friendly years, economic growth years and poor performing years) and then compared these clusters to the energy production in that respective year.
